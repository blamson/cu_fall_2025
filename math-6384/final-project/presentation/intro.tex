\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Project Motivation}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item We wanted to explore the statistical technique known as $L_1$, or, LASSO regression from a linear programming perspective.
        \item Vanderbei claims LASSO works as an LP, so surely it can be done in AMPL.
        \item If so, does this approach reach the same conclusions as standard statistical libraries?
        \item We thought these questions would be a fun way to bridge the gap between statistics and linear programming.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Project Goals}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item To convince ourselves, we perfomed this regression in two ways.
        \item First, using the python library "statsmodels" on a simple dataset.
        \item Second, using our own AMPL model on the same dataset.
        \item Lastly, we compare the model coefficients. Are they the same?
    \end{itemize}
