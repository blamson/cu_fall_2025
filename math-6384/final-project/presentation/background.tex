    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bee populations in the USA have been on a decline for decades due to a variety of factors.
        \item Is this something we can see from a spatial perspective as well? How have the spatial patterns of bee populations changed over time?
        \item My work will focus on the bee populations in Maryland specifically and comparing them across decades.
