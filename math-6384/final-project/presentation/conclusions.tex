\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item There do seem to be some real shifts shown by my results! Hard to draw conclusions though...
        \item Are changes genuine or simply due to random sampling?
        \item Changes may represent shifts in the human process of data collection, not shifts in bee behavior.
        \item To truly understand results I would need additional context on HOW data was collected and how locations were chosen.
    \end{itemize}
