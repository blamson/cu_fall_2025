# eBird Data

eBird has an amazing API and collection of spatial AND time series data for all sorts of birds across the country.

Maybe aggregate to stuff like time of day (morning, afternoon, night) and season and look at patterns for some specific species of bird?

    - Like are the patterns of osprey year round different from the rest of the birds in colorado?
    - Really wanna simplify this data somehow easy to get in over my head here. 
    - Need to use postman to use the API?
