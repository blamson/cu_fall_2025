*Parameters*

```
# Parameters ---
param T integer > 0;
set DAYS := 1..T;
param initial_stock integer >= 0;            # napkins available for start of day 1
param demand{DAYS} integer >= 0;             # Number of napkins needed on day t
param napkin_price > 0;                      # Buy price per single napkin
param wash2_price > 0;                       # Price per napkin for fast laundry
param wash4_price > 0;                       # price per napkin for slow laundry
```

Here we try to keep things simple. I make sure to set the days as an integer and let the prices for the napkins and laundering to be floats. Note here that I assume the price of trashing napkins is free.

*Variables*

```
# Decision Variables ---
var Buy{t in DAYS} integer >= 0;      # clean napkins bought for day t
var Carry{t in 0..T} integer >= 0;    # clean napkins after day t
var Wash2{t in DAYS} integer >= 0;    # used napkins sent to the fast laundry
var Wash4{t in DAYS} integer >= 0;    # used napkins sent to the slow laundry
var Trash{t in DAYS} integer >= 0;    # used napkins discarded after day t
```

Here I make the decision to force only integer values for the napkins. We allow `Carry` to index on 0 so it can function as our initial inventory. 

*Objective Function*

```
minimize Total_Cost:
        sum {t in DAYS} (napkinprice * Buy[t]
        + slowprice * Wash4[t]
        + fastprice * Wash2[t]);

```

Nothing too crazy here. We add up all the stuff that costs money and try to minimize our spend. 

*Constraints*

```
subject to InitialCarry:
        Carry[0] = initial_stock;

# The number of clean napkins acquired through purchase, carryover and laundering on day t
# must equal the number sent to laundering, discarded or carried over after day t.
# Basically, this check ensures that we're tracking all the untrashed napkins correctly
subject to HandlingInventory {t in DAYS}:
        Buy[t] 
        + Carry[t-1]
        + (if t-2 >= 1 then Wash2[t-2] else 0)
        + (if t-4 >= 1 then Wash4[t-4] else 0)
        = demand[t] + Carry[t];

# The number of used napkins laundered or discarded after day t
# must equal the number that were required for that dayâ€™s catering.
subject to UsedNapkins {t in DAYS}:
        Wash2[t] + Wash4[t] + Trash[t] = demand[t];
```

The interesting part with the constraints is making sure that the scheduling for laundering works out appropriately. We want to avoid any indexing issues. Aside from that though I just follow the contraints to the letter given in the problem statement.
