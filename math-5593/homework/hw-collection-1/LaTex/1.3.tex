\section*{Homework 3}

\textbf{Problem} Decide for our running example for which combinations of basic variables we get a basic feasible or infeasible solution via a computation. (From lecture 4).

I'll be using the same system of equations as in homework 2.

\[
	A = \m{v}{1&2&3&0 \\ 1&1&1&1}, \;\; b = \m{p}{6\\4}
\]

To get our basic solution we need to take $A$ and choose 2 subsets of columns from it, $B$ and $N$. The columns we choose for $B$ (the basis) do not need to be consecutive. For each choice, the other two columns will go into $N$.  

We then compute the basic solution as

\[
	x_B = B^{-1}b, \qquad x_N = 0.
\]

A solution is feasible if all components of $x$ are nonnegative. Below I will work through all six possible choices of bases.

\subsection*{Basis columns 1 and 2}

\[
	B = \m{v}{1&2\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{-1&2\\1&-1} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{2\\2}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (2, 2, 0, 0).
\]
All entries are nonnegative, so this solution is feasible.

\subsection*{Basis columns 1 and 3}

\[
	B = \m{v}{1&3\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{-1&3\\1&-1} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{3\\1}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (3, 0, 1, 0).
\]
All entries are nonnegative, so this solution is feasible.

\subsection*{Basis columns 1 and 4}

\[
	B = \m{v}{1&0\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{1&0\\-1&1} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{6\\-2}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (6, 0, 0, -2).
\]
Since $x_4 = -2 < 0$, this solution is infeasible.

\subsection*{Basis columns 2 and 3}

\[
	B = \m{v}{2&3\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{-1&3\\1&-2} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{6\\-2}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (0, 6, -2, 0).
\]
Since $x_3 = -2 < 0$, this solution is infeasible.

\subsection*{Basis columns 2 and 4}

\[
	B = \m{v}{2&0\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{1&0\\-1&2} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{3\\1}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (0, 3, 0, 1).
\]
All entries are nonnegative, so this solution is feasible.

\subsection*{Basis columns 3 and 4}

\[
	B = \m{v}{3&0\\1&1}
\]

\begin{align*}
	x_B &= B^{-1}b \\
	&= \m{v}{1&0\\-1&3} \m{p}{6\\4} \\
	&= \m{p}{2\\2}
\end{align*}

Thus the basic solution is
\[
	x = (0, 0, 2, 2).
\]
All entries are nonnegative, so this solution is feasible.
