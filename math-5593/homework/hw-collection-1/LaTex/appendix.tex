\section*{Appendix}

This section is entirely for containing all of my messy python scripts that I used to complete these homework assignments. These scripts may not show the entire picture, but encompass the bulk of the programming logic behind the scenes.

Below is the script used for 1-3 part A.

Below is the script used for 1-3 parts C and D.

\subsection*{Homework 6 Appendix}

This one has multiple scripts in it as I did a lot of tinkering to get tables in the format that I wanted. Below is the primary one I used for the work.

\textbf{ampl-4-5.py}

I have these other two scripts here incase you want to see them but the bulk of this is just me processing AMPL output into polars dataframes. I do not know why I spent so much time doing this.
