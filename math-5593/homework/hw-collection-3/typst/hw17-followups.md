# 🎓 Oral Exam Follow-Up Questions for Linear Programming Theorem Proofs

## 1. Conceptual Understanding of the Theorem

* Can you restate the theorem in your own words?
* What’s the geometric interpretation of this result?
* Why does the existence of a vertex matter for linear programming?
* How does this theorem connect to the concept of basic feasible solutions?
* In what way does this theorem rely on convexity?
* Could this theorem fail if the feasible region weren’t convex?

## 2. Connections to Broader LP Theory

* Why are vertices so important for solving LPs?
* How does this theorem justify that an LP’s optimal solution can be found at a vertex?
* If the LP has multiple optimal solutions, how does that relate to this theorem?
* How would this extend (or fail) for nonlinear optimization problems?
* What’s the relationship between vertices and extreme points in the feasible region?

---

## 3. Algebraic / Structural Insight

* What is the rank condition for a vertex?
* How do you know which constraints are active at a vertex?
* If ( A ) has linearly dependent rows, what changes?
* Why is it important that the active constraint matrix at a vertex has full rank?
* What happens if we add a redundant constraint?

---

## 4. Variants or Edge Cases

* Does the theorem still hold if ( P ) has no vertices?
* What if the feasible region is unbounded?
* If ( \bar{x} ) lies on an edge or face, can we still use this result somehow?
* What if there’s degeneracy — does it affect the statement or proof?

## 5. Connections to Algorithms

* How does the simplex algorithm rely on this theorem?
* How would this theorem guide your pivot rules in simplex?
* If two vertices share the same objective value, what does that mean geometrically?

---

## 6. Generalizations / Extensions

* Can this theorem be extended to mixed-integer linear programs?
* Could you restate an analogous result for convex nonlinear programs?
* Does this theorem suggest why linear constraints lead to polyhedral feasible regions?
* What would change if inequalities were replaced by equalities?

---

## 7. Proof Technique Reflection

* Why is it enough to show that no nontrivial convex combination produces ( \bar{x} )?
* Where did you use the assumption that ( \bar{x} \in P )?
* Why was the linear independence condition essential in the direction you proved?
* Could you give a counterexample if that condition fails?

Would you like me to tailor this list specifically for the theorem you proved (e.g., “( \bar{x} ) is a vertex if and only if it is an extreme point” or “vertices correspond to basic feasible solutions”)? That would make the questions much more realistic for your oral exam.
