# CU Denver - Fall 2025
Covers the two courses taken in the fall 2025 semester. Those courses being Linear Programming and Spatial Data Analysis.

# Linear Programming (MATH 5593)

> A linear program is an optimization problem that seeks to minimize or maximize a linear function subject to a system of linear inequalities and equations. This course begins with examples of linear programs and variations in their representations. Basic theoretical foundations covered include polyhedra, convexity, linear inequalities and duality. Two classes of solution algorithms are given: simplex methods and interior point methods. The primary emphasis of this course is on mathematical foundations, and applications are used to illustrate the main results. Linear programs are crucial tools in many areas of data science. The course covers three pillars: modeling, theory, and algorithms.

# Spatial Data Analysis (MATH 6384)

> This course will cover various statistical methods for spatial data. This will include assessing cluster identification for point process and regional data, as well as quantifying spatial dependence and making predictions for regional and geostatistical spatial data.
