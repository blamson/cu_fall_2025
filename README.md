# CU Denver - Fall 2025
Covers the two courses taken in the fall 2025 semester. Those courses being Linear Programming and Spatial Data Analysis.

# Linear Programming (MATH 5593)

> A linear program is an optimization problem that seeks to minimize or maximize a linear function subject to a system of linear inequalities and equations. This course begins with examples of linear programs and variations in their representations. Basic theoretical foundations covered include polyhedra, convexity, linear inequalities and duality. Two classes of solution algorithms are given: simplex methods and interior point methods. The primary emphasis of this course is on mathematical foundations, and applications are used to illustrate the main results. Linear programs are crucial tools in many areas of data science. The course covers three pillars: modeling, theory, and algorithms.

|Letter|Range|
|---|---|
|A|[89, 100]|
|B|[78, 88.5]|

A plus or minus will be assigned for borderline cases (roughly one-third of the grade range).

|Item|Grade Percentage|
|---|---|
|Homework| 45%|
|Final Project/Presentation| 30%|
|Mid-Term Exam| 25%|

> The final project 30-point score breaks up to: 10 points for project work and material, 10 points for quality of slides, and 10 for quality of presentation in class. Each of the 3 homework collections is worth 16.5 points, and the total maximum score for homework is 45 (so less than 3 times 16.5). This allows you to achieve full homework score even if some problems are not fully correct. Homework, midterm, and the project will be graded depending on correctness and quality of presentation. A neat writeup is expected (handwritten or typed) for full score. It is always expected that you show your work in detail. 

# Spatial Data Analysis (MATH 6384)

> This course will cover various statistical methods for spatial data. This will include assessing cluster identification for point process and regional data, as well as quantifying spatial dependence and making predictions for regional and geostatistical spatial data.
